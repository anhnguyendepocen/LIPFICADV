# Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization

by Cyrille Rossant

## Chapter 1. Getting Started with IPython

Quick benchmarking with the %timeit command (p. 17)

## Python code

**TODO**:  Figure out if/how this will show results

```{r, engine='python'}
import timeit
timeit.timeit [x*x for x in range(100000)]
```

## R code

**TODO**:  

```{r, results="hold", collapse=TRUE}
system.time(for(x in 1:100000) x^2)
```
