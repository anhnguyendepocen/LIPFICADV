## Chapter 1. Getting Started with IPython

Interactive computing with Pylab (p. 18)

## Python code

**TODO**:  

```{r, engine='python'}
import pylab as pl
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(-10., 10., 1000)
pl.plot(x, sin(x))
pl.show()
```


In [3]: plot(x, sin(x))

## R code

**TODO**:  

```{r, results="hold", collapse=TRUE}
x <- seq(-10.0, 10.0, length.out = 1000)
plot(x, sin(x), type = "l")
```
